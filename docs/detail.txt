Summary
Hey! I’m looking for a reliable dev to help me finalise & tidy up my Session Soundtracks playlist tool — it’s live at app.mapsofthemind.com.

The core filter system is built, but I need help finishing, tweaking & making it future-proof.

✅ Bug fixes & deploy tweaks:
• Small bug fixes
• Final deploy check
• Stripe integration tested (one-off payment, coupon codes working smoothly)
• General content & image polish

✅ Card improvements:
• Show duration on each playlist card (auto-calculate from Spotify API if possible)
• Add mood tags to cards — visible at a glance (users want “calming”, “euphoric”, “introspective”)

✅ Better playlist tagging workflow:
• I want a semi-automatic tagging system for new playlists — mood, genre, duration, intention.
• I do not want to manually listen to 50+ playlists — I want your ideas: pull data from Spotify API? Use a simple AI to suggest moods?
• I should be able to upload playlists in bulk, tweak tags in a simple admin panel & push them live.

✅ Future-proof:
• I want an easy process so I can drop in new playlists once or twice a year — or hand them off to you to handle.
• Bonus points if you have ideas for smart auto-tagging / AI flow.

✅ How we’ll run this:
• Milestone 1 ($100–200): Core fixes, deploy, Stripe test, tidy up.
• Milestone 2 ($300–500): Build the smart tagging/upload system, bulk upload with me, simple admin flow for future use.
• Possible ongoing: I’ll keep you in mind for future batches.

🔑 Must-have:
• Check the live site: app.mapsofthemind.com
• Tell me how you’d handle auto-tagging moods — e.g. pulling Spotify audio features, genre, mood detection, etc.
• Show me similar projects — especially if you’ve worked with Spotify APIs, smart admin dashboards, or music-based tools.
• Start your message with ApPle Pie so I know you read this.

⏱️ Quick timeline:
• Want to hire today/tomorrow.
• Short 15-min call tomorrow UK time (2–6pm) or async chat works too.
• Total budget for now: $500 max, with room to grow if you nail it.

Let’s keep it simple, practical & smooth.

My proposal was :
 ApPle Pie. Hey JOHN. Just checked out app.mapsofthemind.com. You’re 90% there. Cleaning this up, handling deploy bugs, and tightening up Stripe andplaylist tagging are the fun part in this.I’d approach the auto-tagging by pulling Spotify’s audio features(tempo, etc.) and mapping them to mood buckets like “euphoric” or “introspective.” Combine that with genre metadata and a lightweight AI model (Claude or GPT, low-temp) to suggest top 3 moods per playlist. Then we plug that into a small admin panel where you can review, tweak, and hit publish. Recently i am working on a similar project in the niche of sounds but it is more relevant to music producers. I can even give you a demo of exactly what you want. I have one, are you managing playlists manually in a DB now, or is it synced directly via Spotify playlists? Can hop on a call tomorrow at 2-3Pm UK time? Cheers! Hammad Zubair






Client has a demo request :
Hey Hammad,
Cheers for your reply — appreciate you breaking it down so clearly.



A couple of quick bits to help you line up your demo:
👉 The playlists are stored manually in Firebase DB at the moment — not synced from Spotify yet. I find them, build them, and copy in the Spotify link myself. Same for YouTube when needed.
👉 Here’s my static database so you can see what’s there: https://mapsofthemind.com/playlists (password: play)
👉 Could you please do a quick mini-demo using 4 playlists from the live site (https://app.mapsofthemind.com)? Just show me how you’d pull the Spotify audio features, auto-suggest moods (like calming, introspective, euphoric), and how you’d see that being reviewed + approved in a simple admin flow.



I’m looking to keep this easy to update: I’d find new playlists once or twice a year, send you/the system the links, and it handles smart tagging + bulk upload so I don’t have to do it all manually.



One last thing — I’ll be away from the 8th to the 13th of July, so the project might pause for a few days in that window.



If you could share the demo + your thoughts by end of Saturday, that’d be perfect. A Loom is great if you want — whatever’s easiest for you to show how you’d tackle it.



Thanks a lot — looking forward to seeing what you’ve got.
John
