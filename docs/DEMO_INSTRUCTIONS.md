## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If you get API errors:**
- Check your `.env` file has real API keys (not placeholders)
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` signs
- Restart the server after updating `.env`

**If playlists won't analyze:**
- Make sure the Spotify playlist is public
- Try with the sample playlists first
- Check your Spotify API keys are correct

**Quick test without API keys:**
- The demo will start but show "Please configure API keys"
- You can still see the interface design
